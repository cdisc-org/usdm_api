        Phase 1 studies are typically closely monitored and may be conducted in patients
        or normal volunteer subjects. NOTE: These studies are designed to determine
        the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, the side effects
        associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence
        on effectiveness. During Phase 1, sufficient information about the drug''s
        pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects should be obtained to permit
        the design of well-controlled, scientifically valid, Phase 2 studies. The
        total number of subjects and patients included in Phase I studies varies with
        the drug, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80. Phase 1 studies also
        include studies of drug metabolism, structure-activity relationships, and
        mechanism of action in humans, as well as studies in which investigational
        drugs are used as research tools to explore biological phenomena or disease
